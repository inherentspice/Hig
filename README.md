# hig (how's it goin)

## Summary

This was a project I came up with after completing Scrimba's (React Course)[https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact] and unit one, two, and three of the (Full Stack Open Course)[https://fullstackopen.com/en/#course-contents].
\
Living through lockdowns in Shanghai, and general uncertainty in the world, has given me a pretty bleak outlook. Rather than let those feelings paint my world, I made something that would let me get a more objective picture.
\
The technical goal was to create a basic react app that incorporates a live backend. Users simply vote on how their day is going. Votes are saved to a MongoDB database, and accessed by the frontend to paint the accumulative day of all users.
Can also use the history tab to see how good/average/bad days in the past were.
